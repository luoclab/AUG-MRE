# AUG-MRE: Accurate Micro-Expression Recognition via Graph-Based Modeling of Action Unit Correlations

This repository contains the official implementation of AUG-MRE, a novel approach for accurate micro-expression recognition based on graph-based modeling of action unit (AU) correlations. By leveraging the structural relationships between AUs and micro-expressions, our method enhances recognition performance and improves interpretability.
